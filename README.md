## Configuration of Parameters

The simulation parameters are located in the `config.ini` file. To modify the parameters, edit this file with the desired values.

### Structure of the `config.ini` File

The `config.ini` file is divided into sections. Below is an example of its structure:

```ini
[simulation]
initial_height = 10
initial_velocity = 0
h = 0.0001

[params]
ba = 0.1
m = 1
b = 30
g = 9.8
k = 100000
```
